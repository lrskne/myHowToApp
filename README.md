# Assignment from Code Fellows class as follows:

A "How-To" Site

Use your nested-resource powers to create a web app that allows easy creation of multiple How-To lists (step-by-step sequential instructions to complete a task).
Each how-to guide should have nested CRUD-able steps.
The rest is up to you!

Peer Review: Clone the app, get it running, pass along feedback (focus on key functionality, not that all edge-cases are handled).
